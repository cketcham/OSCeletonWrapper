DrawingTree
===========

Control a tree with your body using a Kinect

USAGE
-----

This is a processing sketch which listens to OSC messages send from
[OSCeleton](https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton). You will need to
setup your kinect to send skeleton data. More info on how to do that here:
[http://skyra.github.io/blog/Kinect-Processing/](http://skyra.github.io/blog/Kinect-Processing/)

Once you have that set up, start osceleton on port 12345

    ./osceleton -p 123451
